1)TWO POINTERS:
Types of Two Pointers
1️⃣ Moving in the Same Direction (Left to Right)
One pointer (pos) → Tracks where to place the element.
Another pointer (i) → Moves through the array, finding values.
📌 Example: Moving zeros to the end

📝 Problem:
Move all 0s to the end while keeping non-zero numbers in the same order.

🔹 Step-by-step:
Move i through the array.
If nums[i] is not zero, swap it with nums[pos].
Move pos forward to prepare for the next swap.

2️⃣ Moving Towards Each Other (Start & End)
One pointer (left) → Starts at the beginning.
Another pointer (right) → Starts at the end.
Move them toward each other until they meet.
📌 Example: Checking if a word is a palindrome

📝 Problem:
Check if a word is the same forward and backward.

🔹 Step-by-step:
Start left at the first letter and right at the last letter.
If they don’t match, return false (not a palindrome).
Move both pointers towards the center and keep checking.
